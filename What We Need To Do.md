Things to do to BattleSquads

Battle Squad

Player:

We need to make a full body to the player model. Not just arms.


Get the servers going:

We need to get atleast one server up and runing once the game is done. (Almost done)


Login interface:

We need to make a login interface to store/save all the data from all the players that is playing the game. How many kills they have etc. (Almost Done)


User accounts:

We need to make user accounts to separate the diffrent data from diffrent players. (Almost Done)


Maps:

We need 4 maps atleast. 
Personally I want atleast one sniper map. The rest we can decide later.


Weapons: 

We have all the weapons that we need.


Animations:

We need to make all animations more realistic.


Servers and Networking:

We need to make the movement more realistic and not make it glitchy when the player connects to a server

ADD MORE IF YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING
